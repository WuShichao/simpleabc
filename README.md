SIMPLE-ABC
======

A Python package for Approximate Bayesian Computation
Version 0.1.2



###WARNING! 
This code is still very alpha, use at own risk! 

TODO
----


* Support alternate importance sampling kernel support in Model class
* Set default importance sampling kernel
* Allow PMC to be resarted from the middle of the run
* Add effective sample size to ouput array
* Save Importance Weights so that postierior samples are correct.
* Make own version of triangle plot
* More ABC algorithms 
* Parallelize PMC  
* Better parallellization all around 
* Example scripts


Install
